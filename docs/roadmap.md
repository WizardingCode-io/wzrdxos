# wzrdxOS roadmap

A clean-slate successor to ArkaOS. Phased, with dedicated design sessions for the
two biggest pain points (Knowledge Base and the Org / Teams roster).

## Principles

1. Native first, custom only where it pays.
2. Mandatory flow, low-friction enforcement — every request follows the doctrine
   (task-breakdown, KB-first, document-first, enrichment, evolutive agents; see
   `docs/constitution.md`), enforced natively/intelligently, NOT via brittle blocking
   marker-hooks (the ArkaOS pain).
3. Curated skills, not accumulated.
4. Few, strong agents.
5. KB as a first-class citizen — Graphify (graph) + LanceDB (vectors) + Obsidian (fallback).
6. Open-source from day one (MIT).
7. Mandatory cross-platform auto-install — `setup`/`update` install the full KB stack
   (graphify, LanceDB, services/kb, embeddings) with zero manual steps on Mac/Linux/Windows.

## Milestones

| Milestone | Goal | Design session |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **M1** | Foundations & repo skeleton (formats, registry, CLI, KB stub, CI) | — |
| **M2** | KB deep-dive — Graphify + LanceDB + Obsidian; auto-install (see `docs/kb-design.md`) | ✅ dedicated |
| **M3** | Org / Teams — departments, agent roster, personas | ✅ dedicated |
| **M4** | Skill taxonomy + first skills (process + capability) | — |
| **M5** | Workflow library — quality patterns | — |
| **M6** | Distribution — installer, docs, OSS scaffolding, release | — |

## M1 — Foundations (current)

- Hybrid monorepo: `packages/core` (TS) + `services/kb` (Python via uv).
- Artifact format contract (`docs/formats.md`) + registry loader.
- `wzrdx` CLI: `init`, `status`, `doctor`, `skill new`, `agent new`.
- One example of each artifact (skill / agent / workflow).
- KB MCP stub that starts without crashing.
- CI: typecheck + build + commitlint.

## Open design sessions

- **M2 — KB:** ✅ implemented (slices 1–3). Vector layer (LanceDB + local embeddings),
  cross-platform auto-install (`setup`/`update`/`doctor`), graph build wired to ingestion
  (`graphify update`/`extract`) and GraphRAG fusion (`kb_ask`). All design questions
  resolved in `docs/kb-design.md`. Remaining polish: Obsidian fallback, graphify global
  graph integration, async/watch ingestion.
- **M3 — Org:** ✅ **closed** (PRs #1-#6). 9 departments + Quality transversal,
  C-suite of 9 (CEO·CTO·COO·CMO·CFO·CHRO·CRO·CKO·CQO). 11 agents · 46 skills ·
  3 workflows · 70 declared plugins · daily-intelligence loop (kb_digest /
  kb_enrich) · routing model (`core:conductor` + docs/routing.md) · rule-6 loops
  (skill-promotion + agent-evolution, PR-gated) · `wzrdx company` profile.
  Deferred (gated, documented in org.md): admin email-delegation (needs n8n),
  admin-pt-deadlines + fiscal-pt (zero KB), deploy pruning, lint scope.
- **M4 — Skills & evals:** ✅ infra + trigger baseline (PR #7). Taxonomy
  (`docs/skills.md`) + registry contract test in CI; 45 `evals.json` (105 cases)
  + 10 `trigger_eval.json`; ecological trigger runner (`scripts/trigger_eval.py`)
  with measured 2-round baseline (`docs/eval-baseline.md`) — 8/10 skills >=9
  should-trigger, 9/10 >=9 should-NOT. Deferred: functional with/without
  benchmark (needs isolated env), SDD gate as PreToolUse hook (finding C1).
- **Naming / brand:** wzrdxOS tagline and positioning before public launch.
